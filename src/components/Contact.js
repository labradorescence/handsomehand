    Handmade lettering is a priceless investment for any business, brand or personal project that needs to stand apart. When you work with me, you are getting the benefit of 12 years of letterform obsession, a keen eye for color and spatial design, as well as thoughtful and generous consulting around small design decisions that make all the difference.
