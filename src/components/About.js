    Many people are surprised to hear that Sign Painting is (arguably) the oldest trade in the world. For centuries, Sign Painters have harnessed language and letterform in artful ways to shape culture through commerce, direction and expression. It was only as recent as the 1950's that computers, machines and vinyl adhesive started to take the place of hand lettering. When you choose a hand-painted sign, you are not only participating in a rich history of human creativity, but your sign is guaranteed to have soul!

    Heidi T is an artist, traveler, and owner/operator of Handsome Hand Signs. Influenced by punk rock, graffiti and unconventional approaches, her creations possess a charming and unruly spirit that catch the eye, but still play by the rules. Heidi painted her first sign in 2009 as barter for a hostel in Central America, and officially joined the world of small business in 2018 with a brick and mortar in a rural mountain town. Her business model remains fluid as she prefers to travel for projects whenever possible.
