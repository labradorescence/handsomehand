    1. `npm install react-router-dom`
    2.  watch dev Ed's tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls

    This didn't really work :  https://medium.com/@sschannak/netlify-and-react-router-1537aebe6256

    Had Yarn Build issue and this worked
    
    //package.json
    "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "CI= react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    },
